<p>
  A managed group is considered to be "Verified" if the following are true:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each managed group in the app also exist on AnVIL.</li>
  <li>The service account running the app has the same role (admin vs member) in the app as on AnVIL.</li>
  <li>If the app is an admin of the group, the membership of each group in the app matches the membership on AnVIL.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Otherwise, one or more errors will be reported for that managed group in the "Errors" table.
</p>

<p>
  The audit also checks for any managed groups that are not in the app but have the app service account as an Admin on AnVIL.
  If any exist, they will be reported in the "Not in app" section.
