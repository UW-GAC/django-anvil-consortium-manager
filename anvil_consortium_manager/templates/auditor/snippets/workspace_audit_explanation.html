<p>
  A workspace in the app is considered to be "Verified" if the following are true:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>All workspaces in the app also exist on AnVIL.</li>
  <li>The service account running the app is an owner on AnVIL of all the workspaces in the app.</li>
  <li>Each workspace has the same authorization domains in the app as on AnVIL.</li>
  <li>The access to each workspace in the app matches the access on AnVIL.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Otherwise, one or more errors will be reported for that workspace in the "Errors" table.
</p>

<p>
  The audit also checks for any workspaces that are not in the app but have the app service account as an owner on AnVIL.
  If any exist, they will be reported in the "Not in app" section.
</p>
