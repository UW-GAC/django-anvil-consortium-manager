<p>
  An account is considered to be "Verified" if the following are true:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The account exists on AnVIL.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Otherwise, one or more errors will be reported for that managed group in the "Errors" table.
</p>

<p>
  The audit does not check for accounts that exist on AnVIL but not in the app.
